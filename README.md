jQuery - Progress Bars
===================

jQuery - Animate Multiple Progress Bars

Original code:
  http://workshop.rs/2012/12/animated-progress-bar-in-4-lines-of-jquery/
  http://jsfiddle.net/X5Dxk/
        
I modified this code to use one class for multiple progress bars.
You can use the id to set the maximum value for the progress bar.
				
You can enable the labels of the progress bars in the code, just comment the right line.
